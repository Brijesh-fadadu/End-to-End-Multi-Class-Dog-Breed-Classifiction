## Dog Breed Identification

# Overview

This project is an end-to-end multi-class image classifier built using TensorFlow 2.0 and TensorFlow Hub. The main objective of the project is to identify the breed of a dog given an image of a dog. The project is inspired by the scenario where someone takes a photo of a dog at a cafe and wants to know what breed of dog it is.

# Problem

Identifying the breed of a dog given an image of a dog is a challenging task because there are 120 different breeds of dogs. The problem can be solved using deep learning and transfer learning techniques, which are well-suited for working with unstructured data like images.

# Data

The data used in this project is sourced from Kaggle's Dog Breed Identification competition. The dataset consists of 10,000+ labeled images in the training set and 10,000+ unlabeled images in the test set. The data is available on Kaggle's website at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification/.

# Features

The project deals with images, which are unstructured data. Hence, deep learning and transfer learning techniques are used to build an end-to-end multi-class image classifier. The project aims to identify the breed of a dog from 120 different breeds using the labeled data in the training set. The model is then used to predict the breed of dogs in the unlabeled test set.

# Evaluation

The evaluation metric used in the project is the prediction probabilities for each dog breed of each test image. The model is evaluated based on the accuracy of the predictions. The evaluation is performed using the test set, which contains 10,000+ unlabeled images.

# Usage

To run the code, you need to install the following packages:

TensorFlow 2.0
TensorFlow Hub
The code is available in the Jupyter Notebook format, which can be executed on your local machine or a cloud-based service like Google Colab.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to build an end-to-end multi-class image classifier using TensorFlow 2.0 and TensorFlow Hub. The project shows how to use deep learning and transfer learning techniques to identify the breed of a dog from 120 different breeds. The project also highlights the importance of using labeled data in the training set to build an accurate model for predicting the breed of dogs in the unlabeled test set.
